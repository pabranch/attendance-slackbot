## gAttendance Slack Bot

This bot works only in the gStudents Slack channel.

## How-To

### For Student Use
- Use /attendance-partial to let us know you'll be missing attendance, but you're here today
- Use /attendance-out to tell us you're gonna be out all day
- Use /attendance-update-to-full if you report a partial in the morning, but it becomes a full day 
- Use /attendance-check-total to see your current absence total 
- Use /attendance-policy to see the attendance policy

### For Instructor Use Only
Slack the following commands directly to a student as necessary: 
- Use /attendance-unexcused-partial if someone's misses attendance and is unexcused 
- Use /attendance-unexcused-full if someone is unexcused for the whole day 
- Use /attendance-unexcused-update to change a partial to an unexcused full 
- Use /attendance-remove to remove the most recent reported absence

### Troubleshooting
The server goes to sleep sometimes (Hey, you get what you pay for!). If you don't get a confirmation message, try again immediately. Don't worry- as long as you do it within 10 minutes of an error, it won't count double.
